# Description

In this challenge we were given a finished text editor application and we had to work on the package.json file and update the scripts, and the dependencies. Also, inside the client folder, we had to update the webpack.config.js and add the HtmlWebpackPlugin, CSS loaders and Babel. I also updated the service worker, and lastly, inside the js folder, I updated the buttons event listeners, and the functions inside the database.js
